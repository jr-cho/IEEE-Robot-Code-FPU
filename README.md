# Florida Polytechnnic University's IEEE Robot

## Description
This repository focuses on the software development of the Florida Polytechnic University IEEE's Robot. The goal of this robot is to gather two types of nodes spread randomally across a 4 foot by 8 foot field. We need to be able to search, move, identify, and gather nodes and place them into their designated bins. The robot will start in a 12 inch by 12 inch by 12 inch cube and can expand once the game starts. The robot must be fully autonomus meaning it can not accept outside input.
